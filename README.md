# Capstone Project: Real-Time Vehicle Object Tracking

This repository contains the code, files, and resources for my capstone project on real-time vehicle object tracking.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an efficient video object tracking system specifically for monitoring vehicles. Utilizing convolutional neural networks and other machine learning techniques, the system aims to accurately trace and monitor vehicles in real-time. The project is divided into three stages: algorithm design, implementation, and software deployment.
