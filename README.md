# Capstone Project: Real-Time Vehicle Object Tracking

This repository contains the code, files, and resources for my capstone project on real-time vehicle object tracking.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an efficient video object tracking system specifically for monitoring vehicles. Utilizing **machine learning techniques**, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system aims to accurately trace and monitor vehicles in real-time. The project is divided into three stages: algorithm design, implementation, and software deployment.

## Machine Learning Details

The core of this project is based on a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, a type of machine learning model widely used in computer vision tasks. The CNN was trained to detect and track vehicles within video frames, ensuring high accuracy and real-time performance.

- **Model Training**: The CNN was trained on a labeled dataset to recognize vehicles in various scenarios.
- **Data Processing**: Involved preprocessing video frames and normalizing inputs to prepare the data for model training.
- **Deployment**: The trained model was implemented as part of a desktop application and deployed as a web-based tool.
